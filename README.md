Terminal image program

This is a completly rewritten fork of an old project I called "cursedit". It's
intended purpose is to act as an image manipulation program using a bitmap-like
file format.

Its current status is something not much more than a skeleton version of the old
project. Maybe I'll finish this someday :-)
