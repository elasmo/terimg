Terminal image program

This is a completly rewritten fork of an old project I called "cursedit". Its
intended purpose is to act as an image manipulation program using a bitmap-like
file format, but for terminals.

Its current status is something not much more than a skeleton version of the old
project. Maybe I will finish this someday :-)
